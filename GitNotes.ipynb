    "# Concept of Branches\n",
    "Before trying to understand what branches are in git, we must understand different <b>contexts</b> that might arise during a project\n",
    "## .1) Contexts in a project\n",
    "Suppose we write a program and deployed it and it is currently in production. Now we want to add a new feature. Hum yeh kabhi nae karenge ke apne running code mai changing krna start krdein ur aik unstable feature ko main stable code mai commit karein\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly we could want to add several new features or try to experiment something in our deployed code. So all these things are different contexts. Even bugfix is a sperate context. We would never directly try to change main code to fix a bug. Every topic in the project is a sperate context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way every project contains multiple contexts in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "## .2) Branches and their uses\n",
    "We should use a seperate branch for each context. This approach makes sure that our main code is always safe from unwanted changes. Whenever we want to try something or want to add a new feature or fix a bug, just create a new branch and starting coding in it. Once your team is sure that the changes are stable then just merge your branch with your main code \n",
    "\n",
    "If something went wrong just revert back or you feel like the changes are useless then simply delete the branch and you will be good to go. No worries of affecting the main code\n",
    "\n",
    "### .2.1) Note \n",
    "Their is always at leats one branch present in git repository that is the *master* branch \n",
    "\n",
    "Master branch is automatically created by git when we start a project but we can rename or even delete it. It is just like any other branch\n",
    "\n",
    "## .3) Contents of two branches\n",
    "When we make a new branch, it contains all the contents and files same to same as its parent branch. From this point onwards, if we make some changes in child branch then those changes won't be showed inside parent branch. Similarly, if we make some changes inside parent branches, those changes won't be visible in child branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working in master branch and you have two files in it. Now if you make a branch at this point, the new branch will also contain the two files with same content as they were present in master branch. But afterwards if we make some changes or suppose we create a new file in our new branch, this new file won't be visible in master branch because it is part of anoter branch\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of two branches will remain invisible to each other until they are merged together\n",
    "\n",
    "# Branch Commands\n",
    "Most common branch commands are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git branch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Show list of all branches\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git branch -v`\n",
    "\n",
    "Shows list of all branches with some details like last commit\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git branch branch_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "Creates new branch with the provided name\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `git branch login-form` will create a new branch with name *login-form*\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git checkout branch_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "Switch to 'branch_name' branch \n",
    "\n",
    "- `git merge new-dev`\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge 'new-dev' branch with currently active branch\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git log new-dev..master`\n",
    "\n",
    "Shows commit present in *master* branch but not in *new-dev* branch\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git log master..new-dev`\n",
    "\n",
    "Shows commit present in *new-dev* branch but not in *master* branch"
   ]
  },

   "source": [
    "# Concept of Merge\n",
    "Whenever we want to bring contents present in one branch into another branch, we perform merge operation\n",
    "\n",
    "`git merge dev` merges the contents of `dev` into currently active branch\n",
    "\n",
    "## .1) Difference in logs\n",
    "When a new branch is created, it contains all the logs present in parent branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we make some changes in both parent and child branches. Now we merged child branch into parent branch so, in parent branch all the logs will be added which weren't originally present in it plus an additional log of *merge* will be added in parent branch. This log shows that there was some chnages in both branches at time of merging\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we only made some changes in child branch but not in parent branch and then merge child into parent branch, in this case no *merge* log will be added in parent branch. Just the log which weren't present in parent would be added. This is because there were changes only in one branch and not in both"

    "# Concept of Merge Conflict\n",
    "If we make changes in same file in same line or very close to each other from different branches, then while merging git would be confused and won't be able to merge. It would raise a conflict error. Now the team members who were the owner of those branches have to sit together and resolve the conflict\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the conflict is solved in one branch, it won't cause error while merging two branches inside the second branch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note \n",
    "It is easier to solve merge conflict using GUI tools such"

    "# Concept of stash\n",
    "Suppose we are working on a feature but due to some reason we want to switch branch. It is always bad to commit non usable or unstable code because if we refer back to that commit, the code their would be non usable. This is where stash comes in handy\n",
    "\n",
    "Stashes are temporary place to save changes. This means no snapshots of our code is created but our code remains save even if we restart our workstation\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, commit save changes permanently. Snapshots of our code are created\n",
